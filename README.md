# python-api-challenge

This repository will include all information and work relevant to the Module 6 HW (API). 
All images associated in this assignment can be found in the my images folder.
I accidentally completed some HW provided to me that is not used in this current class. In the VacationPy document there will be a portion where google API is used to created heatmaps based on the relative humidity. Please ignore this as I was informed that this was not part of the assignment.
A config.py file is not provided because I did not want to publicy share my api keys. I will provide a blank config.py file.
